        <h1 class="hero">Upgrade Your Rugby Coaching Education</h1>
        
        <p>Join forward-thinking <strong>rugby coaches and decision-makers</strong> from <mark>25 countries</mark> (and counting) receiving the most unique and elite-level rugby content online.</p>

 <p><strong>But be forewarned:</strong> There will be little value in joining this list for Activity Collectors and those who are simply looking to fill their practice time each week.</p> 

        <p>(If you are looking for poorly-designed, poorly-performed activities, Instagram has you covered.)</p> 
        
 <p><strong>Rugbyology focuses on the bigger picture,</strong> providing opportunities for thinking differently and transcending the medieval worldview that permeates the game.</p> 
        
<p>If you goals align more with building powerhouse programs, winning World Cups with “minnows” or revolutionising the way the game is played this might be the place for you.</p>
